## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### Dataset

The dataset we are going to use is *120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results*. The dataset is extracted from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) and contains data about the athletes that have taken part in the olympics from 1896 to 2016. 

The data contains over 270k entries where each entry corresponds to an athlete taking part in any sportive event. Details we can extract from the data are **Name, Year, NOC (National Olympic Committee), Sport, Event, Medal** among others. 

### Problematic

Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.

What am I trying to show with my visualization?
Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.
Exploratory Data Analysis

### Pre-processing of the data set you chose:

The initial dataset is already quite clean and ready to be used. [TODO]


### Related work

What others have already done with the data?
Why is your approach original?
What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
