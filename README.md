## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### Dataset

The dataset we are going to use is *120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results*. The dataset is extracted from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) and contains data about the athletes that have taken part in the olympics (summer and winter) from 1896 to 2016. 

The data contains over 270k entries where each entry corresponds to an athlete taking part in any sportive event. Details we can extract from the data are **Name, Year, NOC (National Olympic Committee), Sport, Event, Medal** among others. 

This dataset is already clean and ready to use, so we only need to do the explorations to get the results that we want to visualize.

### Problematic

**TODO: Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop. (Explain what we want to visualize -in general terms- and what's the story that will guide you through**


Visualizations using the olympics as data are not new. Some good examples are: 
* [The Winter Games, by Elbert Wang](https://www.dremio.com/the-winter-olympics/)
In this visualization they show the evolution of the winter olympics across different topics (number of participants, number of sports, host cities, etc.). We can take it as inspiration for some graphics (how it display medals per country looks nice) but we would like to create something more interactive where the user has more control over the data it wants to see. 

* [App Olympics Data, by Matthew Rautionmaa](https://matthewrautionmaa.shinyapps.io/Olympic_Shiny/) 
This app provides different plots using the same dataset as we plan to use. In this case, the number of plots is large and many topics are already explored. Nevertheless, no further information is shared with the user and the degree of interactivity is very limited. 

Although they share very interesting plots and even share a story with them, we miss some more interactivity with the user as well as completness. Given these two examples, we want to create something that allows the reader to extract information and interact in different levels. We want our visitors to learn more about the olympics, from general facts that may not be that well known, to more detailed information that requires further analysis. The idea is that no matter how you landed in our page, you will obtain what you were looking for:
  
  ** If you are just visiting and want to learn some general facts to later share with your friends, some text will accompany the different visualizations so that even without further engagement you can extract these facts. 
  
  ** If you are more interested in the topic and want to explore further, interactive visualizations will allow you to do so and get more insights by yourself. 

### Pre-processing of the data set you chose:

The initial dataset is already quite clean and ready to be used. **TODO: Add some insights that we extracted from the data; link to the notebook**


### Related work

Visualization with olympic data were shown in the section [Problematic](### Problematic)

Some inspiration from other projects that are specially interesting because they outstand in one of the points we are trying to achieve with our visualization are: 

* [Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) usually presents similar transitions on their data stories to the one showed in [The Winter Games, by Elbert Wang](The-Winter-Games,-by-Elbert-Wang). One example is ['Where will you need an umbrella?'](https://pudding.cool/2020/02/rain/) where they combine some data plots together with text and as the user advances the same plot introduces new data as the text displays new information. 

* A more interactive and engaging project is ["Based on a True Story, from Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/). This project shows different movies and signals which parts are actually based on real stories and which parts are not. The interesting point is the level of freedom the user has at the time of selecting a movie and a part of it to read new information. 

* [Missing Flights, by The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/21/business/coronavirus-airline-travel.html). The project provides an very nice animation at the begginning comparing two scenarios. The animation allows the user to easily spot the differences (in terms of density of flights). A few information is shared at the begginning (some highlights) and then, for those users who are more interested, a more developed explanation is followed. This format looks very interesting because it allows the user to choose to which level of depth it wants to explore the information. Either it can choose to just look at the initial animation and get the important points or it can continue reading further for more details.
